# Python : Making a Discord Bot
## **What** is Discord
Discord is a social media. Just like Facebook , Line, Instagram...etc, the main purpose of using these apps is to keep in contact with others. But how is Discord different from others?

## **Why** Discord

### Creating community

A server, or also known as a guild, is used for creating communities. What "creating communitites" means is that you can invite a lot of people who have same interest to the server you created , and talk about it on Discord. 
You might have a question here: "Why do I have to use Discord since most of the other social media has the same function of creating communities?"

### Convenience
Because of the good connection of voice calling ,Discord was widely used by gamers back to 2016. It also allows you to text someone ,create a group, or even create a server. Making it convenient to control everyone, Discord enables you to catagorize people by using its "role" function. What "role" does is that you can manage permissions, such as changing the channel name, who can type in specific channels, or even banning someone from the server. With the role function, you can easily change the server within a few clicks--if you have the permission to do it of course. For instance, if you have administrator, you can announce something important to everyone in the Discord server you created by using "mention". If you mention someone, they'll be notified. Sometimes it would be annoying to recieve these notifactions, especially when they're playing games. So think before you tag them, or they might get angry at you.

### Channels
In a server, you can create channels to catagorize different topics of messages , which helps managing the server. There are 2 types of channels, text channel and voice channel. You can type in text channels, while you can talk to others in voice channel. Looking simple, but actually there is more possibilities than you thought.
For example, making a announcement channel is a dream-come-true. You can announce something important, and the members, who wasn't given permission to send messages in the announcement channel by using the "role" function, won't be able to mess up your messages. Therefore you can not only have a nice and neat channel which only contains your announcements, but also better for people to read.

### Screen sharing
Like Google Meet, you can share your screen to others. This can help if you have a presentation to do, or just simply want to stream your gameplay to your friends. You simply join a voice channel, click screen sharing, choose the app you want to screen share, and its right there. 
There's probably another question in your mind :"If so, why do I have to use Discord? Google Meet has the same function of Screen sharing!". Well, nice question. 
So basically, the difference of Screen sharing in between Google Meet and in Discord is that you can have multiple people screen sharing at once in Discord while you can only have 1 person screen sharing at once in Google Meet. Furthermore, you can choose better quality for your stream in Discord while in Google Meet it's always just pain to look at.

### Bots

#### What is a Discord bot?
Discord bots are an user account that you can invite to your server and make it function with your code.
There are tremendous amount of Discord bots, countless possibilities that you can do with discord bot. Imagination is the only limit.

#### What can a Discord bot do?
You can do things , type in commands to make it do something you want, for instance, playing music in voice channels, making a caculator with it. You can also design a rpg game where you can compete with your friends, or helping managing the server -- "roles", "permissions", "banning", "kicking".

#### What is special about Discord bot?
Even with the fact that it can do so many things, it is pretty much free to make a Discord bot just for you and your friends. All you need is knowing the basics about coding and how to actually understand the API.
